# Yoga Posture Image Classification
●	Implemented 2 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification with and without regularization and data augmentation techniques. Evaluated model performance on validation and testing datasets with error analysis. Ran on 520+70 images in total.  
●	Conducted feature extraction on CNNs and visualized feature space using k-nearest neighbor (KNN) analysis.
