# Yoga Posture Image Classification
This repository contains the implementation of two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification of yoga postures, with and without regularization and data augmentation techniques.

## Overview
The objective of this project was to classify images of yoga postures using CNNs. We trained and evaluated two models: one with regularization and data augmentation techniques, and one without. The models were trained on a dataset of 520 images and tested on a separate set of 70 images. We also conducted error analysis to evaluate the model performance in terms of average precision and F1 scores. 

## Feature Extraction
We conducted feature extraction on the CNNs and visualized the feature space using k-nearest neighbor (KNN) analysis.
